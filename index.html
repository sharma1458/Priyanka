    <p>I know I haven't been the best at expressing my love physically, and I'm truly sorry. You're right, actions speak louder than words (or reels!). You're absolutely amazing, and I want you to know how much you mean to me. From our late-night talks to just being comfortable in silence, you make me feel a happiness I can't describe.</p>

    <p>I feel incredibly comfortable with you, both mentally and physically. You challenge me, make me laugh, and inspire me to be a better person. I miss seeing those sweet messages you send (and maybe teasing you a little!)</p>
    <p>Aur ha main baat do you feel comfortable with me.</p>

    <p>Even if you throw tantrums (because yes, I will probably irritate you!), know that it's because you're so special to me.  </p>
